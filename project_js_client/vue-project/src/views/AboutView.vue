            Fox is a synonym of babe, hottie, snacc, and shawty. Those who are
            foxy are considered conventionally sexy and attractive.<br />

            The term foxy (meaning "attractive" or "stylish") originated in the
            late 19th century. In the 1940s, foxy gave rise to the term fox
            (meaning "attractive person"). These days, older (sometimes
            out-of-touch) men are most likely to use the term fox, when
            referring to a DDG woman.

            People who are foxy are either sneaky or good looking. If you say
            someone is foxy, unless she has a long skinny nose and is stealing
            your eggs, you probably mean sheâ€™s hot.
